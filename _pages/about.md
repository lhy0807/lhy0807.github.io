Welcome! I'm a graduate student at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu). I'm currently researching topics related to robot perception at the [RIVeR lab](https://robot.neu.edu/) under the supervision of Prof.Taskin Padir.
