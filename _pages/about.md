Welcome! I'm a graduate student at [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu). I'm currently researching topics related to robot perception at the [RIVeR lab](https://robot.neu.edu/) under Prof. [Taskin Padir](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/padir-taskin/) and co-advised by Prof. [Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/).

My research interest lies at the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, i.e., robot perception. Perception is at the essence of numerous robotics fields, and my current works focus on modeling the environment and object interaction accurately and efficiently.

I got my B.S degree in Computer Science and Economics (dual major) from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu/).
