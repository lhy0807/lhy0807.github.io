Welcome! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://brown.edu). I work with [Prof. Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/) at the [Interactive 3D Vision & Learning Lab](https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/). I'm also working as an Applied Scientist intern at the Innovation Lab, [Amazon Fulfillment Technologies & Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-fulfillment-technologies-robotics/).

My research interests revolve around the convergence of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, particularly in the field of robot perception (vision and touch) and planning. Perception and planning play a crucial role in various robotics domains, and I am currently focused on developing deep learning models for environment and object interaction.

Before joining Brown University, I worked with [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/) and [Prof. Taskin Padir](https://robot.neu.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu). I also completed two research internships at the <a href="https://usa.honda-ri.com/">Honda Research Institute</a>.

I serve as a reviewer for conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CVPR, ECCV, Humanoids, AAAI, and CHI, as well as journals including RA-L, Neurocomputing, among others.
