Welcome! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://brown.edu).
My research interests revolve around the convergence of robotics, machine learning, and computer vision, particularly in the co-design of robot perception (vision and touch) and planning. Perception and planning play crucial roles in various robotics domains, and I am currently focused on developing deep learning models for environmental and object interaction.

I've done three great research internships: one at the Innovation Lab, [Amazon Fulfillment Technologies & Robotics](https://www.linkedin.com/company/amazon-fulfillment-technologies-robotics/), and two at the <a href="https://usa.honda-ri.com/">Honda Research Institute</a>.
Before joining Brown University, I worked with [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/) and [Prof. Taskin Padir](https://robot.neu.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu). 

I serve as a reviewer for conferences such as ICRA, IROS, CVPR, ECCV, Humanoids, AAAI, and CHI, as well as journals including RA-L, Neurocomputing, among others.
