Welcome! I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Brown University](https://brown.edu). I work with [Prof. Srinath Sridhar](https://cs.brown.edu/people/ssrinath/) at [Interactive 3D Vision & Learning Lab](https://ivl.cs.brown.edu/).

I completed my Master's degree at [Northeastern University](https://northeastern.edu), where I conducted research on topics related to robot perception and navigation with the guidance of [Prof. Huaizu Jiang](https://jianghz.me/) and [Prof. Taskin Padir](https://robot.neu.edu/).

I had the opportunity to intern as a researcher at <a href="https://usa.honda-ri.com/">Honda Research Institute</a> (HRI). Throughout my two internships at HRI, my research primarily focused on visuotactile manipulation perception. I had the privilege of being supervised by Dr. Nawid Jamali and Dr. Soshi Iba.

My research interests revolve around the convergence of computer vision, machine learning, and robotics, particularly in the field of robot perception (vison, tactile, point cloud, etc.). Perception plays a crucial role in various robotics domains, and I am currently focused on developing accurate and efficient models for environment and object interaction.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Economics (dual major) from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu/).
